# Openshift Authentication Plugin for SonarQube 

## Description

This plugin enables user authentication and Single Sign-On via OpenShift. It is heavily based on the code by Julien Lancelot. Tested on version 7 of Sonarqube and OCP 3.11. It is intended to run deployed in a pod on OpenShift.

This plugin is designed to work out of the box without configuration. During plugin deployment, it looks up oauth information from OpenShift's well-known information and takes advantage of information already on the running pod. 

During deployment the plugin will:

- Look up well-known oauth information at https://openshift.default.svc
- Pull the service account client_id, secret and cert from the file system 
- Pull the OpenShift API location from the env variables of the pod
- Get the ServiceAccount name from the API
- Get the Route of the service that is coordinating sonarqube for callback. This relies on the service name being available in the configuration (via sonar.properties). As a fallback it will default to `sonarqube`

## Installation

This plugin is not currently hosted anywhere. So build and place this plugin on to the volume where Sonarqube reads plugins at startup. Typically, this might be `/opt/sonarqube/data/plugins`.

The service account can be used as the oauth client in OpenShift. The service account that runs Sonarqube should have a redirect uri that references the route that Sonarqube is using. You must specify this service account in the DeploymentConfig.

```
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ServiceAccount
  metadata:
    annotations:
      serviceaccounts.openshift.io/oauth-redirectreference.sonarqube: '{"kind":"OAuthRedirectReference","apiVersion":"v1","reference":{"kind":"Route","name":"sonarqube"}}'
    name: sonarqube
```

The service account must have the ability to view routes in the project. 

```
oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:sonarqube-project:sonarqube
```

The environment variable sonar.auth.openshift.isEnabled must be set to true. The preferred way is to place that value in the sonar.properties file during your container build:

```
sonar.auth.openshift.isEnabled=true
```

You may also enable it in the Administrative console
 
## Configuration

This plugin will map OpenShift roles to Sonarqube roles. These values are set with the property (shown with the default value if property is not set)

```
sonar.auth.openshift.sar.groups=admin=sonar-administrators,edit=sonar-users,view=sonar-users
```

The default shown will allow admin users of the project the role of sonar-administrators of Sonarqube. Edit and View role users will be added as sonar-users.

You may choose the background color of the log in button with the property

```
sonar.auth.openshift.button.color=#666666
```

Set the kubernetes API. In the example the API is set automatically with environment variables

```
kubernetes.service=https://${env:KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST}:${env:KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT}/
```

See the example set up using the [OpenShift Applier](https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-applier) [here](example/README.md)

## Development on OpenShift

If you are making changes to this codebase, you'll want to build and deploy the changes to OpenShift. Follow these steps:

1. Do a maven build in the base folder of this project

```
mvn clean package
```

2. Replace the released version of the plugin with the built version. If using the example
 - update the example/Dockerfile to use the newly built file
 - start the build using the oc client

```
oc start-build sonarqube --from-dir=. -n sonarqube-project-name
```

Ensure that the new jar has replace the old jar on the OpenShift PV
